## Software Questions
Software Questions is a web application where you can test your skills in various programming languages. Users log in to the site, select a programming language, and participate in a session related to that language. During the session, multiple-choice questions are asked regarding the selected language. After answering the questions, users can see how many they answered correctly and incorrectly.

## Technologies Used
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) : A React-based server-side rendering framework that enables building high-performance and developer-friendly web applications.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org): A library for easily adding authentication to Next.js applications.
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used for database access and querying.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework that facilitates building modern and responsive web designs.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) A TypeScript-based RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that streamlines server-client communication.

## Features
